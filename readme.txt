Year Make Model Search plugin will help customer to find all products for specific vehicle make, model and year.


== Description ==

This simple plugin was created specially for WooCommerce.
It can be used only for automotive stores.
It has fixed number of drop-downs - three and the Year is the last drop-down.
There is no way to change order of the drop-downs and make the Year drop-down first.

Product restrictions are used as values for front-end drop-downs.
It means that if a customer can select "Acura CL 1997" there is a product with this restriction.
If you need to change "Bmw" to "BMW" in the drop-down you should find the product with that restriction and replace "Bmw" with "BMW".
You should be careful when you set product restrictions to not make duplicates like "Lexus ES-300" and "Lexus ES300". Because both of them will be selectable on front-end an they will point to different products.


**Main Features:**

* Search for products on home page
* Filter products on category page
* List applicable vehicles on front-end product view page
* CSV import / export for product restrictions


**Main Limitations:**

* Fixed number of drop-downs - three and Year is the last drop-down.
* Product restrictions are used as values for user drop-downs. So it is posible to make by mistake duplicates like "Lexus ES-300" and "Lexus ES300".
* Product restrictions use comma-separated format which can be difficult to fill manually.
